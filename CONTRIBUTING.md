## Contributions

To request a feature, report a bug, or suggest improvements to documentation for this repository:
* create an issue using the Github Issues tool
* if you would also like to contribute a fix, then create a pull request referencing that issue. 

Anyone with a github account may create an issue, but there are some constraints (see below) on who may contribute pull requests.

## Constraints on merging 

As with all projects in Islandora Labs, all contributors to a pull request must have an Islandora 
CLA ([Contributor License Agreement]) on file before it can be merged. 
Here, a contributor is defined as the author of a git commit.

In Islandora Labs, the policies for merging may be different from the standard [Islandora Committer's Workflow]. 
These policies are set at the discretion of the Current Maintainer, as defined in this project's README.md.

In this project, the following policies apply:
* Only members of the [Islandora Labs Committers Group] may merge pull requests.
* A person may *not* merge their own pull requests, nor a pull request that they have contributed code to.
* A formal review (using Github's Review feature) is *not* required.
* A pull request may be merged at any time after it is created.
* A person *may* merge code contributed by another employee of the same organization.
